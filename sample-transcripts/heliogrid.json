Second, our AI learns each building's unique patterns and optimizes in real-time. Third, we guarantee savings. If we don't hit our targets, we pay the difference.",

Nothing that looks dated or too corporate. Definitely avoid the cliche green leaf sustainability imagery - we're beyond that. Also no literal solar panels or buildings in the logo.",
